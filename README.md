## Work Experience
**Research Assistant @ Information Science Institute (USC) (_June 2023 - Present_)**
- Developing a distributed EDGE system incorporating security features to counter potential cyber or AI-related attacks. We explore possible optimization strategies for private inference algorithms using MPC protocol.

**Senior Analyst in Software Engineering @ NatWest Group, Bengaluru (India) (_September 2020 - August 2022_)**
- Designed dialogue flow for NatWest Mobile Banking Application’s CORA chatbot using IBM Watson Assistant for Covid-19 related conversational AI journey/skill to help customers and businesses bank online.
- Continuously developed and Maintained CORA chatbot’s usability with new features and modifications to dialog flow, debugging through monthly releases to interact with 11 million users.
- Developed an email content classification and data extraction application. Along with LSTM, tested the application with multiple machine learning models and increased the accuracy of the application from 67% to 81%.

## Projects
### Llama 2 Finetuning
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

- Efficiently fine-tuned Llama2 7B model on a single GPU with multiple strategies such as gradient accumulation, gradient checkpointing, mixed precision training, and low-rank adaptation on the Alpaca dataset and analyzed the performance and cost of the model with limited computational resources (memory).

### Computer Vision for American Sign Language
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

- Developed a fine-tuned deep neural network model to recognize ASL hand gestures. Trained the model with 27000 images of gestures with varying properties and achieved 66% accuracy on the unseen test dataset with different image properties.
- Developed a Python script that utilizes the trained models to detect and live transcribe ASL hand gestures using the Google text-to-speech (gTTS) library.
