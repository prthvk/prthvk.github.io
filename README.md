<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Hi! My name is Prithvik and I'm a graduate with Master’s in Electrical Engineering (Machine Learning and Data Science) from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, with a couple of years of industry experience. A student of AI with proven ability to design, develop, and deploy secure and efficient machine learning models across diverse domains.</p>
    
<p>My area of focus is Natural Language Processing (NLP), with experience in LLM fine-tuning and RAG applications. Possesses strong expertise in deep learning frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow), MLOps tools (MLFlow, Azure ML), and distributed computing (Spark, Hadoop). Demonstrated success in building CI/CD pipelines and optimizing model performance for real-world applications.</p>
    
<p>I am eager to contribute my skills and knowledge to a team passionate about using ML to solve real-world problems. I am confident that I can quickly learn and adapt to new challenges, and I am always looking for new ways to improve my skills and knowledge. A well-rounded skill set, coupled with a strong academic and professional background, make me an ideal candidate for roles such as Machine Learning Engineer, Data Scientist, and MLOps Engineer.</p>
